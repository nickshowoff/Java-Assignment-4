**2.13 (Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly interest
rate is After the first month, the value in the account
becomes
100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
After the third month, the value in the account becomes
(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays
the account value after the sixth month. (In Exercise 4.30, you will use a
loop to simplify the code and display the account value for any month.)
0.05/12 = 0.00417.
Enter the monthly saving amount:
After the sixth month, the account value is $608.81



import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter the monthly saving amount:");
  double saving = input.nextDouble();
  double accountvalue1 = saving * 1.00417;
  double accountvalue2 = (saving + accountvalue1)*1.00417;
  double accountvalue3 = (saving + accountvalue2)*1.00417; 
  double accountvalue4 = (saving + accountvalue3)*1.00417;
  double accountvalue5 = (saving + accountvalue4)*1.00417;
  double accountvalue6 = (saving + accountvalue5)*1.00417;
  
  System.out.println("After the sixth month, the account value is $" + accountvalue6);    

 } 
}
