*2.21 (Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that
reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays
the future investment value using the following formula:
futureInvestmentValue =
investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12
For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of
years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.
Here is a sample run:
Enter investment amount:1000
Enter annual interest rate in percentage:4.25
Enter number of years:1
Accumulated value is $1043.34

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter investment amount:");
  double investment = input.nextDouble();
  System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate in percentage:");
  double interestrate = input.nextDouble();
  System.out.print("Enter number of years:");
  double years = input.nextDouble();
  double futureInvestmentValue = investment * Math.pow((1 + interestrate/100),years*12);

  System.out.println("Accumulated value is $" + futureInvestmentValue);    

 } 
}
