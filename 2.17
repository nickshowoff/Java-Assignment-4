*2.17 (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is
not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative
humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In
2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature
to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The formula is:
where is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the speed
measured in miles per hour. is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot be
used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below or above
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between and
and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill temperature.
Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. Here is a sample run:
Ë›41F
-Ë›58F
Ë›- 41F. Ë›58F
twc
ta
twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit:
Enter the wind speed in miles per hour:
The wind chill index is -5.56707

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit:");
  double ta = input.nextDouble();
  System.out.print("Enter the wind speed in miles per hour:");  
  double speed = input.nextDouble();
  double twc = -99999999;
  if (ta >= -58 && ta <=41) {
  twc = 35.74 + 0.6215*ta - 35.75*Math.pow(speed,0.16) + 0.4275*ta*Math.pow(speed,0.16);
} 
  
  System.out.println("The wind chill index is " + twc);    

 }
