the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter the subtotal and a gratuity rate:");
  double subtotal = input.nextDouble();
  double gratuityrate = input.nextDouble();
  double gratuity = subtotal*gratuityrate/100;
  double total = subtotal + gratuity;
  System.out.println("The gratuity is $" + gratuity + "and total is $" + total);    

 }
