**2.6 (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and
1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the
sum of all its digits is 14.
Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the
extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.
Here is a sample run:
Enter a number between 0 and 1000:
The sum of the digits is 27

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter a number between 0 and 1000:");
  int number = input.nextInt();
  int sumofdigits = (number%10) + (number/10%10) + (number/100);
  System.out.println("The sum of the digits is " + sumofdigits);    

 } 
}
