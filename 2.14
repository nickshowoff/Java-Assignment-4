*2.14 (Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and
dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the
user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note
that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters. Here is
a sample run:

Enter weight in pounds: 50
Enter height in inches: 95.5
BMI is 26.8573

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter weight in pounds:");
  double weight = input.nextDouble();
  System.out.print("Enter height in inches:");
  double height = input.nextDouble();
  double BMI = weight * 0.45359237 / Math.pow(height * 0.0254,2);
  
  System.out.println("BMI is " + BMI);    

 } 
}
