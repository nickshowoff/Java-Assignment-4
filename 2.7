*2.7 (Find the number of years) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the
minutes. For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days. Here is a sample run:
Enter the number of minutes:
1000000000 minutes is approximately 1902 years and 214 days

mport java.util.Scanner;

public class java { 
  public static void main(String[] args){ 
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter the number of minutes:");
  int minutes = input.nextInt();
  int years = minutes/60/24/365;
  int days = (minutes - years*365*24*60)/60/24;
  System.out.println(minutes + " minutes is approximately " + years + " years and " + days + " days");    

 } 
}
